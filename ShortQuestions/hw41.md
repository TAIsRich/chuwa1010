## HW8 Springboot RUD

1. **List all of the new annotations to your annotaitons.md and explain its role**


2. **how do you do the debug?**

   - click the right side of number of each line that you want to stop to get the result.
   - check with error message if it has error


3. **what is DTO, VO, Payload, DO?**

   - DTO: data transfer Object, carries useful data between processes / systems.
   - VO: value object
   - Payload: contains the data that could be stored or updated
   - DO: data object

   
4. **what is @JsonProperty("description_yyds")?**

   Add @JsonProperty to indicate the property name in JSON 
when we're dealing with non-standard getters and setters
   ```aidl
   public class MyBean {
       public int id;
       private String name;
   
       @JsonProperty("name")
       public void setTheName(String name) {
           this.name = name;
       }
   
       @JsonProperty("name")
       public String getTheName() {
           return name;
       }
   }    
   ```


5. **do you know what is jackson?**
   ```aidl
   <dependency>
    <groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.core</groupId>
    <artifactId>jackson-databind</artifactId>
    <version>2.13.3</version>
    <scope>compile</scope>
   </dependency>
   ```

   Jaskson is used to map java objects to JSON format


6. **what is spring-boot-stater? what dependecies in the below starter? do you know any starters?**
   ```aidl
   <dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
   </dependency>
   ```

   - we need to add the dependency in pom.xml
   - spring-boot-stater makes it easy to create stand-aloneï¼Œ production-grade spring based application s that you can just run.
   - the above starter is spring-boot-starter-web
   - other starter: spring-boot-starter-data-jpa, spring-boot-starter-data-mongodb


7. **do you know @RequestMapping(value = "/users", method = RequestMethod.POST) ? could you list CRUD by this style?**

   use @RequestMapping to map different HTTP request in the controller class  
   CRUD:
   - @RequestMapping(value = "/users", method = RequestMethod.POST)
   - @RequestMapping(value = "/users", method = RequestMethod.GET)
   - @RequestMapping(value = "/users", method = RequestMethod.PUT)
   - @RequestMapping(value = "/users", method = RequestMethod.DELETE)


8. **what is ResponseEntity? why do we need it?**
   ```aidl
   new ResponseEntity<>(postResponse, HttpStatus.OK);
   new ResponseEntity<>(postResponse, HttpStatus.CREATED);
   ResponseEntity.ok(postService.getPostById(id));
   ```
   ResponseEntity is used to represent the whole http response such as status code, headers and body. And, we can use it to handle the http response  


9. **what is ResultSet in jdbc? and describe the flow how to get data using JDBC**

     ResultSet is used to represent the set of database query.
   - import the package
   - load driver
   - build connection
   - create query statement
   - write query object
   - execute query using query statement
   - process result
   - terminate the connection


10. **what is the ORM framework?**

    ORM is Object relational mapping. It is used to convert data between different types of systems   


11. **Learn how to use ObjectMapper by this example.**

  


12. **what is the serialization and deserialization?**
   - serialization: the process of converting data objects to a portable format (JSON, XML...)
   - deserialization: the reverse process, recreating data objects from a portable format


13. **use stream api to get the average of the array [20, 3, 78, 9, 6, 53, 73, 99, 24, 32].**
```
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
      int[] arr={20,3,78,9,6,53,73,99,24,32};
      double result = Arrays.stream(arr).average().orElse(Double.NaN);
      
      System.out.println(result);
    }
}
```
