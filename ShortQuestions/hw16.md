Aspect Oriented Programming(AOP): Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) is an approach to programming that allows global properties of a program to determine how it is compiled into an executable program. AOP can be used with object-oriented programming ( OOP ). An aspect is a subprogram that is associated with a specific property of a program. Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) complements Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) by providing another way of thinking about program structure.

Aspect-oriented programming gives you a way to encapsulate this type of behavior functionality. It allows you to add behavior such as metrics "around" your code. For example, AOP provides you with programmatic control to specify that you want calls to BankAccountDAO to go through a metrics aspect before executing the actual body of that code.

advantages of spring AOP:It is non-invasive. It is implemented in pure Java. It uses Spring’s IOC for dependency injection.

As any other AOP framework, it weaves cross cutting concerns into the classes, without making a call to the cross cutting concerns from those classes.

Centralize or modularize the cross cutting concerns (read meaning of cross cutting concerns above), don’t need to logging

Provision to create aspects using schema based (XML configuration) or @AspectJ annotation based style ,Easy to configure


disadvantages: Since it uses proxy based AOP, only method level advising is supported, doesn’t support field level interception. Only methods with public visibility will be advised.

An aspect is a class that implements enterprise application concerns that cut across multiple classes, such as transaction management. Aspects can be a normal class configured through Spring XML configuration or we can use Spring AspectJ integration to define a class as Aspect using @Aspect annotation.

**6**

Pointcut: Pointcut is expressions that are matched with join points to determine whether advice needs to be executed or not. Pointcut uses different kinds of expressions that are matched with the join points and Spring framework uses the AspectJ pointcut expression language.

**7**

Join point:  A join point is a specific point in the application such as method execution, exception handling, changing object variable values, etc. In Spring AOP a join point is always the execution of a method.

**8**

Advice:  Advices are actions taken for a particular join point. In terms of programming, they are methods that get executed when a certain join point with matching pointcut is reached in the application


types: Based on the execution strategy of advice, they are of the following types.

Before Advice: These advices runs before the execution of join point methods. We can use @Before annotation to mark an advice type as Before advice.

After (finally) Advice: An advice that gets executed after the join point method finishes executing, whether normally or by throwing an exception. We can create after advice using @After annotation.

After Returning Advice: Sometimes we want advice methods to execute only if the join point method executes normally. We can use @AfterReturning annotation to mark a method as after returning advice.

After Throwing Advice: This advice gets executed only when join point method throws exception, we can use it to rollback the transaction declaratively. We use @AfterThrowing annotation for this type of advice.

Around Advice: This is the most important and powerful advice. This advice surrounds the join point method and we can also choose whether to execute the join point method or not. We can write advice code that gets executed before and after the execution of the join point method. It is the responsibility of around advice to invoke the join point method and return values if the method is returning something. We use @Around annotation to create around advice methods.

**9**

Proxy:  Spring AOP implementation uses JDK dynamic proxy to create the Proxy classes with target classes and advice invocations, these are called AOP proxy classes. We can also use CGLIB proxy by adding it as the dependency in the Spring AOP project.

When to use Spring Batch: The spring boot batch chunk aids in the configuration of the execution. Spring Boot Batch includes reusable functions such as logging/tracing, transaction management, job processing statistics, job restart, skip, and resource management that are necessary when processing large volumes of records.

**12**

Spring batch works: 

Spring Batch follows the traditional batch architecture where a job repository does the work of scheduling and interacting with the job.

A job can have more than one step. And every step typically follows the sequence of reading data, processing it and writing it.

And of course the framework will do most of the heavy lifting for us here — especially when it comes to the low-level persistence work of dealing with the jobs — using sqlite for the job repository.

**13**

schedule a Spring Batch Job: Configure Spring Batch Jobs in two different ways: Using the @EnableScheduling annotation. Creating a method annotated with @Scheduled and providing recurrence details with the job. Then add the job execution logic inside this method

Swagger: Swagger is an open source set of rules, specifications and tools for developing and describing RESTful APIs. The Swagger framework allows developers to create interactive, machine and human-readable API documentation.
