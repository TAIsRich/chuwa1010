3. Aspect-Oriented Programming complements Object-Oriented Programming by providing another way of thinking about program structure. The key unit of modularity in OOP is the class, whereas in AOP the unit of modularity is the aspect. Aspects enable the modularization of concerns such as transaction management that cut across multiple types and objects.

4. Advantage:

   1. Helps developers to deal with cross-cutting concerns
   2. Implemented in pure Java
   3. Uses Springâ€™s IOC container for dependency injection

   Disadvantage:

   1. Hard to debug
   2. Only method-level advising is supported
   3. Only methods with public visibility will be advised
   4. Aspects cannot advise other Aspects

5. An aspect is a class that implements enterprise application concerns that cut across multiple classes, such as transaction management.

6. Pointcut is expressions that are matched with join points to determine whether advice needs to be executed or not.

7. A join point is a specific point in the application such as method execution, exception handling, changing object variable values.

8. Advices are actions taken for a particular join point. In terms of programming, they are methods that get executed when a certain join point with matching pointcut is reached in the application. The types of advices including before, after, around, afterThrowing.

9. AOP proxy is an object created by the AOP framework in order to implement the aspect contracts.

11. Spring batch can be used when processing large volumes of records, since it provides reusable functions including logging/tracing, transaction management, job processing statistics, job restart, skip, and resource management.

12. Spring Batch follows the traditional batch architecture where a job repository does the work of scheduling and interacting with the job. A job can have more than one step. And every step typically follows the sequence of reading data, processing it and writing it.

13. Creating a method annotated with @Scheduled or using the @EnableScheduling annotation.

14. Swagger is a set of open-source tools built around the OpenAPI Specification that can help you design, build, document and consume REST APIs.
