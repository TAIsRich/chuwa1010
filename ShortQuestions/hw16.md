# Homework 16
## Testing

### 1. List all of the new learned annotations to your annotations.md
### 2. what is selenium(YouTube)?
Selenium is an open-source E2E/TDD (End-To-End/Test Driver Development, in which a developer writes failed tests then complete the code to pass tests) test automation framework for web applications mainly used for functional and performance testing with support to all major operation systems, browsers, and programming languages and has integration with TestNG.
 1. Selenium Remote Control (RC) -> Selenium WebDriver: Main component that automates browser actions with cross platform compatibility.
 2. Selenium Grid makes it possible for parallel testing on several machines with different deployment environments, in which a hub is responsible for coordinating tests between different machines.
 3. Selenium IDE is an browser extension that visualizes testing scripts with real actions executed on browser.

### 3. what is cucumber(youtube)?
Cucumber is a BDD (Behavior-driven Development) testing tool in which the perspective are built upon the software's business need/features, by defining the software's expected behavior in plain, human-readable language instead of programming languages. It is mainly used for "story" testing.

### 4. what is JMeter(youtube)?
JMeter is a load testing tool to analyze performance on web applications by stimulating a heavy load on the server where the application is deployed.

### 5. what is unit-test?
Unit-test is a testing concept in which a component (a Java class) is tested for its own expected functionalities regardless of other components functionalities, with mock classes been supplied to provide required resources for the testing unit to consume.

### 6. What is the life cycle of Junit?
 1. `@BeforeAll` defines actions in a static method that need to be executed on the entire class level for only once
 2. `@BeforeEach` defines actions that need to be executed before each test
 3. `@Test` defines the actual method with testing actions.
 4. `@AfterEach` defines actions that need to be executed after each test and usually is a clean up.
 5. `@AfterAll` defines actions in a static method that need to be executed on the entire class level after all tests are executed to clean up.
### 7. Is @BeforeAll method should be Class level(static)?
Yes. It is in a static method that needs to be executed only once for all tests.
### 8. What is Mockito? and what is its limitations?
Mockito is a testing framework used for unit-testing by providing mock objects and data to avoid dependency on other software components.
Its limitation includes not be able to mock constructors, private methods, static methods, and final classes.
### 9. What is @Mock and what is @InjectMocks?
The instance decorated with `@Mock` will be the template class that the mock's behaviours will be made from.
The instance decorated with `@InjectMocks` will be the class where the made mock will inject to.

### 10. What is the stubbing?
Stubbing is to simply return a needed value just for the unit test rather than mocking the whole behavior of the class.

### 11. what is Mockito ArgumentMatchers
Mockito ArgumentMathers defines certain argument types/contents with a specified return behavior.
### 12. what is Hamcrest Matchers
Hamcrest Matchers are more flexible matchers to provide highly customizable intent match.
### 13. do you know @spy? what is difference between @spy and @Mock?
`@Spy` defines a partial mock of a class in which certain behaviors uses the real class, while `@Mock` is a full mock class with no actual behavior of the real class.
