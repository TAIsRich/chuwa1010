###### 3. What is the Aspect Oriented Programming?
Aspect oriented programming(AOP) can be defined as the breaking of code into different modules, also known as modularisation, where the aspect is the key unit of modularity. Aspects enable the implementation of crosscutting concerns such as transaction, logging not central to business logic without cluttering the code core to its functionality. It does so by adding additional behaviour that is the advice to the existing code. 
###### 4. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Spring AOP?
- Advantages - 
1. AOP is non-invasive:
Service or Domain classes get advice by the aspects (cross-cutting concerns) without adding Spring AOP related classes or interfaces into the service or domain classes.
Allows the developers to concentrate on the business logic, instead of the cross-cutting concerns.
2. AOP is implemented in pure Java:
There is no need for a special compilation unit or special class loader
3. It uses Spring’s IOC container for dependency injection:
Aspects can be configured as normal spring beans.
4. Like any other AOP framework, it weaves cross-cutting concerns into the classes, without making a call to the cross-cutting concerns from those classes.
5. Centralizes or modularizes the cross-cutting concerns:
Easy to maintain and make changes to the aspects.
Changes only need to be made in one place.
6. Provision to create aspects using schema-based (XML configuration) or @AspectJ annotation based style.
7. Easy to configure.
- Disadvantages - 
1. A small difficulty is debugging the AOP framework-based application code.
Since the business classes are advised after the scene with aspects.
2. Since it uses proxy-based AOP, only method-level advising is supported; it does not support field-level interception
So join-points can be at method level not at field level in a class.
3. Only methods with public visibility will be advised:
Methods with private, protected, or default visibility will not be advised.
4. There's small runtime overhead, but its negotiable:
The overhead is in nano-seconds.
5. Aspects cannot advise other Aspects - it's not possible to have aspects as targets of advice from other aspects.
Because once you mark one class as an aspect (either use XML or annotation), Spring excludes it from being auto-proxied.
6. Local or internal method calls within an advised class don’t get intercepted by proxy, so the advice method of the aspect does not get fired or invoked.
7. It is not for advising fine-grained objects (or domain objects) — it is best suitable for coarse-grained objects due to performance.
###### 5. What is Aspect in Spring AOP?
An aspect is the modularization of a concern that cuts across multiple classes. An aspect is a class to define all aop self methods. Aspect is associated with a pointcut expression and runs at any join point matched by the pointcut.
###### 6. What is Pointcut in Spring AOP?
PointCut is a predicate or expression that matches join points. It is used as a condition to find all main application methods to insert AOP. 
###### 7. What is the Join point in Spring AOP?
Joint point is a point of execution of the program, such as the execution of a method or the handling of an exception. In Spring AOP, a joint point always represents a method execution.
###### 8. What does it mean by Advice and its types in Spring AOP?
Advice defines when to execute aop methods when the application pointcut is found.
@Before – Run before the method execution
@After – Run after the method returned a result
@AfterReturning – Run after the method returned a result, intercept the returned result as well.
@AfterThrowing – Run after the method throws an exception
@Around – Run advice before and after the advised method is invoked.
###### 9. What is Spring AOP Proxy?
AOP proxy: an object created by the AOP framework in order to implement the aspect contracts (advise method executions and so on). In the Spring Framework, an AOP proxy will be a JDK dynamic proxy or a CGLIB proxy.

###### 11. When to use Spring Batch?
Spring Batch provides reusable functions that are essential in processing large volumes of records, including logging/tracing, transaction management, job processing statistics, etc. Spring Batch can run jobs periodically. 
###### 12. How Spring Batch works?
Jobs are defined in a JobRepository, and JobLauncher will invoke a certain job.
When a Job is called, ItemReader will read the data from the database, and ItemProcessor will proceed the data based on the steps, ItemWriter will return the result.
###### 13. How can we schedule a Spring Batch Job?
Method1: Using the @EnableScheduling annotation.
Method2: Creating a method annotated with @Scheduled and providing recurrence details with the job. Then add the job execution logic inside this method.
###### 14. What is Swagger?
Swagger is a set of open-source tools that can help you design, build, document and consume REST APIs.
