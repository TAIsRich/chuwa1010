#### 3.  What is the Aspect Oriented Programming?
Aspect Oriented Programming which allow programmer add advice which is a kind of additional function before, after or around a function.
#### 4.  What are the advantages and disadvantages of Spring AOP?
advantages
non-invasive: would add additional functions but not change the original code and bussiness logic.
pure-java.
use IOC: can inject dependency, can be configured as normal beans.
easy to configure.
centralize or modularize the cross cutting concerns.

disadvantages
difficult to debug.
only public method can be advised.

#### 5.  What is Aspect in Spring AOP?
Aspect is a place allows pointcut to connect with advice. 
We declare pointcut and advice here and define which function would use which advice in a class annotated by @Aspect
#### 6.  What is Pointcut in Spring AOP?
Pointcut is the a code block that we want to add advice.
#### 7. What is the Join point in Spring AOP?
Join point is the code blocks that can be pointcut and add advice, which is each function in spring.
#### 8.  What does it mean by Advice and its types in Spring AOP?
Advice is the common bussiness logic that is picked up and united and will wrapped to the pointcuts.
@Before execute before pointcut
@After  after pointcut
@Around define both before and after logic
@AfterReturning after the pointcut functions return
@AfterThrowing after an error or exception threw.
#### 9.  What is Spring AOP Proxy?
Proxy is the wrapped class. When a bean has pointcuts, spring would generate a proxy with the advice logic instead of a original bean without advice functions.
#### 11. When to use Spring Batch?
When have huge amount of jobs or data and is not urgent, we can use spring batch.
#### 12. How Spring Batch works?
JobRepository hold jobs, for each job, it can be processed by multiple steps. 
In steps, use ItemReader to read data, ItemProcessor to operate data and ItemWriter to write data.
To launch those jobs, use JobLauncher.

#### 13. How can we schedule a Spring Batch Job?
@Scheduled before the function
#### 14. What is Swagger?
It is a tool that can help us to generate document of RESTful APIs of our spring application.
