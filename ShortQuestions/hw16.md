## HW16 - Spring AOP & Batch & Swagger

##### 1.List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotaitons.md

##### 2.What is the Aspect Oriented Programming?

AOP is a programming technique that aims to increase modularity by allowing the separation of cross-cutting concerns.

The cross-cutting concerns represent the functionality that is required and repeated in different methods, such as logging, transaction management, and security.

So, with AOP we can declare these new code separately and leave them out of the main application.

##### 3.What are the advantages and disadvantages of Spring AOP?

- Pros
  - Separated with our business layer, easy to configure
  - implemented in pure Java, so separate compilation unit or separate class loader are not required
  - uses Springâ€™s IOC for dependency injection
- Cons
  - Debugging the AOP framework based code is a little difficult
  - Only public methods can be advised
  - Aspects cannot be advised by other aspects

##### 4.What is Aspect in Spring AOP?

The class that defines and implements all cross-cutting concerns, annotated with @Aspect

##### 5.What is Pointcut in Spring AOP?

It represents a set of join points (application methods) where the AOP should be inserted

##### 6.What is the Join point in Spring AOP?

It represents a point (a method execution) in the application where you can plug-in the AOP aspect

##### 7.What does it mean by Advice and its types in Spring AOP?

> We often associate the Advice with a Pointcut expression, and it runs at any Join point matched by the Pointcut.

It is the actual action to be taken at a join point, different types include:

@Before, @After, @Around, @AfterReturning, @AfterThrowing

##### 8.What is Spring AOP Proxy?

A proxy is an object that wraps the real object. AOP proxy is an object created by the AOP framework in order to implement the aspect and invoke the advice. 

##### 9.When to use Spring Batch?

Spring Batch is usually used on the application which requires a lot of batch processing. Batch processing includes typical tasks such as reading and writing to files, transforming data, reading from or writing to databases, creating reports. So in such situation, using the Spring Batch will be useful. It provides functions and features that are essential in processing large volumes of data.

##### 10.How Spring Batch works?

The JobRepository does the work of scheduling and interacting with the job (batch processing).

A job have one or more steps (contains necessary info to define and execute the job). And each step typically follows the sequence of reading data, processing data and writing data.

##### 11.How can we schedule a Spring Batch Job?

Creating a method annotated with @Scheduled and using the cron expressions

##### 12.What is Swagger?

It's an open source project used to generate the REST API documents. It provides a user interface which allow us to call and test our REST APIs.
