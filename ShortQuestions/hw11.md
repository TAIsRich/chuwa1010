1. List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotaitons.md

2. what is the @configuration and @bean?

   [@Configuration](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/users/configuration) annotation allows us to use annotations for [dependency injection](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/spring-dependency-injection).

   @Bean annotation tells that a method produces a bean to be managed by the Spring container. It is a method-level annotation. During Java configuration (`@Configuration`), the method is executed and its return value is registered as a bean within a `BeanFactory`.

3. How do you handle the exception in Spring?

   @ExceptionHandler

   ​	Method Level

   ​	used to handle the specific exceptions and sending the custom responses to the client

   @ControllerAdvice

   ​	Class Level

   ​	to handle the exceptions globally

   Steps  
   1.  create ErrorDetails Class
   2.  Create GlobalExceptionHandler Class
   3.  Test using Postman Client

4. How do you do the validations in Spring?

   1. import dependency

   2. add validation rule to payload

      @NotEmpty

      @Size(min = ?, message = "error message")
   3. add @valid to controller to apply the rule here

      public ResponseEntity<PostDto> createPost(@Valid @RequestBody PostDto postDto){}
   4. check it in Postman

5. What is the actuator?

   Actuator brings production-ready features to our application.

   **Monitoring our app, gathering metrics, understanding traffic, or the state of our database become trivial with this dependency.**

   The main benefit of this library is that we can get production-grade tools without having to actually implement these features ourselves.

   Actuator is mainly used to **expose operational information about the running application** — health, metrics, info, dump, env, etc. It uses HTTP endpoints or JMX beans to enable us to interact with it.
