# Homework 18
## Microservice
### 1. list all of the new annotations you learned to your annotations.md
### 2. Document the microservice architecture and components/tools/dependencies
 1. Zuul API Gateway: When a request comes in, the gateway directs the request to a corresponding microservice deployed on a Docker container according to physical address found on Eureka Service Registry
 2. Docker: is the virtual container/server on which the microservice is deployed.
 3. Eureka Service Registry: maps each microservice's actual address with a look-up name so that it can be easily located no matter how network environment changes
 4. Ribbon Load Balancer: If Service 1 has multiple identical copies deployed on different machines, the load balancer will distribute the amount of work equally on different copies.
 6. Hytrix Circuit Breaker: Microservice 1 might need to call another service to get some necessary data, from which it will look up the address from Eureka Service Registry and request from another service. However, if another service is down, the circuit breaker would tell Service 1 so that it doesn't need to repeatedly request while not getting a response.
 7. Kafka: Call requests between microservices might be put into a queue to be consumed.
 8. Spring cloud Config Server: There is a centralized configuration file where all microservices can use to look up configurations and dependencies. 

### 3. What are Resilience patterns? What is circuit breaker?
- Times out: If another microservice takes too long to give a response, the response will simply be returned as time out to prevent the microservice from being waiting too long.
- Fail fast: If one microservice waits too long, then it better gives some type of error code.
- Bulkhead: Each type of request can uses its own thread pool, so that different types of request does not interfere with each other when error occurs.
- Circuit breaker: If a error is returned from a microservice, then the circuit breaker will be on and not allow any call to pass through.
