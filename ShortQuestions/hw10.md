# Homework 10
### 1.  List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotaitons.md
Please see *annotations.md*
### 2.  type the code, you need to checkout new branch from branch 02_post_RUD, name the new branch with https://github.com/TAIsRich/springboot-redbook/tree/hw05_01_slides_JPQL.
Please see *MavenProject\redbook-jpql*
### 3.  What is JPQL?
JPQL is the query language syntax used in Java persistance level provided by JPA specifications, which references relational database entity by Java class name instead of table name.
### 4.  What is @NamedQuery and @NamedQueries?
`@NamedQuery` is used in the Java entity class to define a name for a JPQL query. `@NamedQueries` is used to collect all named queries into one single collection for the class.
### 5.  What is @Query? In which Interface we write the sql or JPQL?
`@Query` is also used to define a JPQL/SQL query by decorating the abstract methods in the repository (DAO) interface.s
### 6.  What is HQL and Criteria Queries?
HQL is a hibernate query language extended from standard JPQL, which shortens query string by omitting the "SELECT *" syntax. Criteria queries uses a criteria object to specify the SQL equivalent of WHERE statement conditions.
### 7. What is EnityManager?
EntityManager is the component at Java persistance level that manages connections and performs operations such as merge(), persist(), between database and Java repository.
### 8.  What is SessionFactory and Session?
Session is a conversation instance between Java persistance level and relational database where the operations are communicated and performed. SessionFactory manages sessions by producing, closing or reusing a session when needed, which decouples production of session objects from Java persistance level.
### 9.  What is Transaction? how to manage your transaction?
A transaction is a series of operations that are grouped together as atomic, which mean either all operations are performed or the state of database has to be rolled back to original state. Such operations can be grouped together as a transaction by using `@Transactional` decorator on the methods of business logic to ensure CRUD with ACID properties.
### 10. What is hibernate Caching?
Hibernate Caching is the Spring Data JPA Hibernate mechanism with a lazy read from the database that provides a persistance level caching to read data if data is already fetched from database.
### 11. What is the difference between first-level cache and second-level cache?
First-level cache reuses data from the same session and is turned on by default, while second-level cache can reuses data from different sessions and has to be turned on by configuration.
### 12. How do you understand @Transactional? (不要clone，要自己抄写并测试transactional，c)
Please see *MavenProject\transaction*
### 13. Write a simple factory design pattern.
