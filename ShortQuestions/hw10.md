1. List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotaitons.md

2. type the code, you need to checkout new branch from branch **02_post_RUD**, name the new branch with **https://github.com/TAIsRich/springboot-redbook/ tree/hw05_01_slides_JPQL**.

3. What is JPQL?

   JPQL is Java Persistence Query Language defined in JPA specification. 
   It is used to create queries against entities to store in a relational database. 
   JPQL is developed based on SQL syntax. But it won’t affect the database directly.

4. What is @NamedQuery and @NamedQueries?

   @NameQueries annotation is used to define the multiple named queries. 
   @NameQuery annotation is used to define the single named query.

   @NamedQueries({
       @NamedQuery(name="Country.findAll",
                   query="SELECT c FROM Country c"),
       @NamedQuery(name="Country.findByName",
                   query="SELECT c FROM Country c WHERE c.name = :name"),
   }) 

5. What is @Query? In which Interface we write the sql or JPQL?

   A Query is similar in syntax to SQL, and it's generally used to perform CRUD operations. The @Query annotation takes precedence over named queries.

   By default, the query definition uses JPQL. SQL also works.

6. What is HQL and Criteria Queries?

   Hibernate Query Language (HQL) is an object-oriented query language, similar to SQL, but instead of operating on tables and columns, HQL works with persistent objects and their properties.
   The criteria query API lets us build nested, structured query expressions in Java, providing a compile-time syntax checking that is not possible with a query language like HQL or SQL. 

   - HQL is to perform both select and non-select operations on the data,  but Criteria is only for selecting the data
   - HQL is suitable for executing Static Queries, where as Criteria is suitable for executing Dynamic Queries

7. What is EnityManager?

   The EntityManager is an API that manages the lifecycle of entity instances. 
   An EntityManager object manages a set of entities that are defined by a persistence unit. 
   Each EntityManager instance is associated with a persistence context.

8. What is SessionFactory and Session?

   SessionFactory is a factory class for Session objects. 
   It is available for the whole application while a Session is only available for particular transaction. 

9. What is Transaction? how to manage your transaction?

   A transaction is a logical unit of work that contains one or more SQL statements, simply represents a unit of work.
   A transaction is an atomic unit -  if one step fails, the whole transaction fails (which is termed as atomicity). 

   Transaction management refers to the tasks of processing multiple transactions issued by various clients of a database server in such a way that the ACID contract can be fulfilled
   Transaction management is generally understood as requiring serializability-based concurrency control as well as recovery from failures. 
   Concurrency control is the task of scheduling transactions such that their serializability can be guaranteed, 
   while recovery has to restore a consistent database state after a system or media failure. 

10. What is hibernate Caching?

    [Cache](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/hibernate-caching-first-level-cache)

    Caching is a mechanism to enhance the performance of a system. It is a buffer memorythat lies between the application and the database. Cache memory stores recently used data items in order to reduce the number of database hits as much as possible.

11. What is the difference between first-level cache and second-level cache?

    The first level is maintained at the Session level and accessible only to the Session, while the second level cache is maintained at the SessionFactory level and available to all Sessions. This means, you can use the first-level cache to store local data, i.e. the data which is needed by the Session, and you can use the second-level cache to store global data, i.e. something which can be shared across sessions.
