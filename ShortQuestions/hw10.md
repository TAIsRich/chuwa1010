3. JPQL is Java Persistence Query Language defined in JPA specification. It is used to create queries against entities to store in a relational database. JPQL is developed based on SQL syntax.
4. A named query is a statically defined query with a predefined unchangeable query string. @NameQuery annotation is used to define the single named query, and @NameQueries annotation is used to define the multiple named queries.
5. @Query annotation means that value attribute of the method with this annotation contains the JPQL or SQL query to execute.
6. HQL which means Hibernate Query Language is a language similar to SQL but works with persistent objects and their properties. HQL queries are translated by Hibernate into conventional SQL queries, which in turns perform action on database. The criteria query can be used to build nested, structured query expressions in Java, providing a compile-time syntax checking that is not possible with a query language like HQL or SQL.
7. EntityManager is used to access a database in a particular application. It is used to manage persistent entity instances, to find entities by their primary key identity, and to query over all entities.
8. A Session is used to get a physical connection with a database, and it provides an API enabling us to create, read, update, and delete persistent objects. SessionFactory is a factory class which we get sessions and perform database operations.
9. A transaction represents a unit of work so that if one step fails, the whole transaction fails (which is termed as atomicity). A transaction can be described by ACID properties.
10. Caching is a buffer memory that lies between the application and the database which stores recently used data items in order to reduce the number of database hits as much as possible. In Hibernate we have first-level cache and second-level cache.
11. The first-level cache is mandatory which all requests must pass, but the second-level cache is optional. Also the first-level cache is maintained at the Session level and accessible only to the Session, while the second-level cache is maintained at the SessionFactory level and available to all Sessions.
