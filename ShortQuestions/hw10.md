## HW10 - Spring Data Part II

1. **List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotaitons.md**

2. **type the code, you need to checkout new branch from branch 02_post_RUD, name the new branch with hw05_01_slides_JPQL.**

3. **What is JPQL?**

   Java Persistence Query Language, defined in JPA specification. It is used to create queries against entities to store in a relational database.

4. **What is @NamedQuery and @NamedQueries?**

   Using @NamedQuery to declare a query in the entity class (persistence layer) and reference and use it in the repository (business layer). This makes it easy to reuse an existing query and separate the definition of query from the business code.

   Using @NamedQueries when there's multiple queries, each query starts with @NamedQuery.

5. **What is @Query? In which Interface we write the SQL or JPQL?**

   Using @Query to declare a query inside the repository.

   By default, the query definition uses JPQL. Or we can use native SQL to define the query.

6. **What is HQL and Criteria Queries?**

   HQL is Hibernate Query Language. It is similar to SQL but the code's readability is poor. 

   Criteria Queries enable the user to write queries without using the raw SQL.

7. **What is EntityManager?**

   The EntityManager manages connection to a database as well as to database operations. All operations on the entity go through the EntityManager. It provides a collection of methods which allow us to interact with the database. When we declare an EntityManager object we should mark it with the @PersistenceContext annotation.

8. **What is SessionFactory and Session?**

   Hibernate uses its own classes to represent persistence context which are SessionFactory and Session. SessionFactory is used to create sessions. Similar to the EntityManager, Session provides a collection of methods allow us to interact with the database.

9. **What is Transaction? how to manage your transaction?**

   Transaction represents a unit of work. The main goal of a transaction is to provide ACID characteristics to ensure the consistency and validity of data. We can activate the transaction by session `session.beginTransaction()`, then commit or rollback the transaction by: `transaction.commit()`, `transaction.rollback()`

10. **What is hibernate Caching?**

    Caching is a mechanism to enhance the performance of a system. The cache memory stores recently used data items so that the number of times of accessing the database can be reduced. The Hibernate caching utilizes a multi-level caching scheme.

11. **What is the difference between first-level cache and second-level cache?**

    - the first level cache is associated with the Session object, the first level cache is enabled by default and is a mandatory cache
    - the second level cache is mainly used for caching object across sessions, it is an optional cache and is always being used after the first-level cache

12. **How do you understand @Transactional?**

    We can use the @Transactional annotation to tell the Spring that a transaction is required to execute the method or the class that contains methods.

13. **Write a simple factory design pattern.**

    ```java
    public interface Coffee {
        public String getName();
    }
    ```
    
    ```java
    public class AmericanCoffee implements Coffee {
        @Override
        public String getName() {
            return "American Coffee";
        }
    }
    ```

    ```java
    public class LatteCoffee implements Coffee {
        @Override
        public String getName() {
            return "Latte Coffee";
        }
    }
    ```
    
    ```java
    public class SimpleCoffeeFactory {
        public Coffee createCoffee(String type) {
            Coffee coffee = null;
    
            if ("american".equalsIgnoreCase(type)) {
                coffee = new AmericanCoffee();
            } else if ("latte".equalsIgnoreCase(type)) {
                coffee = new LatteCoffee();
            } else {
                throw new IllegalArgumentException("Sorry, not a valid coffee type");
            }
    
            return coffee;
        }
    }
    ```

    ```java
    public class Client {
        public static void main(Stirng[] args) {
            SimpleCoffeeFactory factory = new SimpleCoffeeFactory();
            Coffee coffee = factory.crateCoffee("lattee")
            System.out.println(coffee.getname());
        }
    }
    ```
