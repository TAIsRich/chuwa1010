###### 1. List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotaitons.md
###### 2. type the code, you need to checkout new branch from branch 02_post_RUD, name the new branch with https://github.com/TAIsRich/springboot-redbook/tree/hw05_01_slides_JPQL.
###### 3. What is JPQL?
JPQL is Java Persistence Query Language defined in JPA specification. It is used to create queries against entities to store in a relational database.
###### 4. What is @NamedQuery and @NamedQueries?
- @NamedQuery annotation is used to specify a named query within an entity class and then declare that method in repository.
- @NamedQueries annotation is used to specify multiple queries within an entity class and then declare the methods in repository.
###### 5. What is @Query? In which Interface we write the sql or JPQL?
@Query annotation is used to execute both JPQL and native SQL queries. In the repository interface (dao) we write the sql or JPQL. 
###### 6. What is HQL and Criteria Queries?
- Hibernate Query Language (HQL) is an object-oriented query language, similar to SQL, but instead of operating on tables and columns, HQL works with persistent objects and their properties. 
- Hibernate Criteria Queries is an alternative to SQL or JPQL, to build nested, structured query expressions in Java. 
###### 7. What is EnityManager?
The EntityManager is an API that manages the lifecycle of entity instances. An EntityManager object manages a set of entities that are defined by a persistence unit. Each EntityManager instance is associated with a persistence context.
###### 8. What is SessionFactory and Session?
SessionFactory in Hibernate is responsible for the creation of Session objects. The Hibernate Session provides methods such as save, delete and update, all of which are used to perform CRUD-based operations on the database to which the SessionFactory connects.
The session object provides an interface between the application and data stored in the database.
###### 9. What is Transaction? how to manage your transaction?
- A transaction simply represents a unit of work. 
- @Transactional annotation can be added to a transaction so that if all the operation are successful then perform commit otherwise rollback all the operations. 
###### 10. What is hibernate Caching?
Hibernate caching is a buffer memory that lies between the application and the database. Cache memory stores recently used data items in order to reduce the number of database hits as much as possible. Hibernate provides two level cache. 
###### 11. What is the difference between first-level cache and second-level cache?
Hibernate first level cache is session specific while second level cache is sessionFactory specific. If an instance is in first level cache, it's return from there. Otherwise it will proceed to second level cache. If no result neither, database will be visited to find the instance. 
###### 12. How do you understand @Transactional? (不要clone，要⾃⼰抄写并测试transactional，https://github.com/TAIsRich/tutorial-transaction)
We can use @Transactional to wrap a method in a database transaction. It allows us to set propagation, isolation, timeout, read-only, and rollback conditions for our transaction.
###### 13. Write a simple factory design pattern
