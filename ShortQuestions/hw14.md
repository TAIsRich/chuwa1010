2. MVC pattern means Model-View-Controller pattern, which separates an application into three main groups of components: Models, Views, and Controllers. Model represents an object carrying data. It can also have logic to update controller if its data changes. View represents the visualization of the data that model contains. Controller acts on both model and view. It controls the data flow into model object and updates the view whenever data changes. It keeps view and model separate.
3. Front-Controller is a design pattern which means that all requests that come for a resource in an application will be handled by a single handler and then dispatched to the appropriate handler for that type of request.
4. DispatcherServlet is a front controller of Spring. Below is how it works:
   1. Tomcat send the HTTP request to DispatcherServlet
   2. DispatcherServlet call HandlerMapper with the request
   3. HandlerMapper find the proper Controller and method and return them to DispatcherServlet
   4. DispatcherServlet call the method
   5. DispatcherServlet call view resolver with the view name returned
   6. View resolver return the view template to DispatcherServlet
   7. DispatcherServlet call view engine to fill the model into the view template
   8. DispatcherServlet return the HTML to the browser
5. JSP is a server-side programming technology that enables the creation of dynamic, platform-independent method for building Web-based applications. ModelAndView is a holder for both Model and View in the web MVC framework. Note that these are entirely distinct. This class merely holds both to make it possible for a controller to return both model and view in a single return value. Represents a model and view returned by a handler, to be resolved by a DispatcherServlet. The view can take the form of a String view name which will need to be resolved by a ViewResolver object; alternatively a View object can be specified directly. The model is a Map, allowing the use of multiple objects keyed by name.
