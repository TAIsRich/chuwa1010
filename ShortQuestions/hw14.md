HTTP sessions is an industry standard feature that allows Web servers to maintain user identity and to store user-specific data during multiple request/response interactions between a client application and a Web application. 

**3**

A cookie is information that a website puts on a user's computer. Cookies store limited information from a web browser session on a given website that can then be retrieved in the future.

**4**

cookie: front end storage with small size, can be used with every http request, popular for application with independent front end. Cookies end on the lifetime set by the user. client-side files on a local computer that hold user information

session: back end storage, has expiration time(~ 20 mins), corresponding to front end tab. When the user quits the browser or logs out of the programmed, the session is over.) usually used with jsp. server-side files that contain user data.

**5**

In the first step, the client request to the server via GET or POST method.
The sessionID is created on the server, and it saves the sessionID into the database. It returns the sessionId with a cookie as a response to the client.
Cookie with sessionID stored on the browser is sent back to the server. The server matches this id with the saved sessionID and sends a response HTTP200

spring security filter: help add authentication and authorization to the web application. Spring security filter chain consist of multiple filters according to needs.

**7**

BCryptPasswordEncoder

**8**

UserDetailService: retrieving a username, password, and other attributes for authenticating with a username and password.

AuthenticationProvider: perform a specific authentication

AuthenticationManager:  interface for authentication. It has a list of AuthenticationProviders and calls the authenticate method of the appropriate AuthenticateProvider.

AuthenticationFilter: A Filter that performs authentication of a particular request

**9**

disadvantage of session: Performance overhead in case of large number of user, because of session data stored in server memory. 

Solution: Using cookie to instead.

**10**

JWT: JSON Web Token is a proposed Internet standard for creating data with optional signature and/or optional encryption whose payload holds JSON that asserts some number of claims. The tokens are signed either using a private secret or a public/private key.

**11**

How JWT works:

Client sends the POST request for authenticating the username and password.

Server validates the username and password, then generates the JWT using secret key. 

Server returns the generated JWT to client.

Client sents GET request with JWT in the HTTP header.

Server validates JWT using secret key and returns the response to the client.

**12**

To get value from applications.properties, use the @Value annotation.

E:
```Java
@Value("${userBucket.path}")
private String userBucketPath;
```

**13**

configure(HttpSecurity http): set authorization to user according to Spring Security

configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth): authentication based on encoding of users' password, account

**14**

Spring security authentication: check whether the user could sign in.

E: whether user A could sign in using this username and password

authorization: check the user whether have the permission to do some action.

E: whether user A could modify something or just could use it
