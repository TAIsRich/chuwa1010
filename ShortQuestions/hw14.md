# Homework 14
### 1.  List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotaitons.md
### 2.  What is MVC pattern?
MVC pattern stands for Model-View-Contoller, where Contoller handles the http request sent by a front end controller with business logic that populates a View object sent to front end contoller as a response with data trasmitted through a Model object.
### 3.  What is Front-Controller? 
A Front-controller processes a request by mapping it to a relevant API controller and returns a complete response to the front end after the view is populated with model data.
### 4.  What is DispatcherServlet? please decribe how it works.
DispatherServlet handles the data transforamtion between http request, responses, DTOs, and MVC interactions.
1. Request is sent to DispatcherServlet
2. DispatcherServlet requests data from handler mapper
3. DispatcherServlet receives relevant controller and method from handler mapper
4. DispatcherServlet executes relevant controller and method
5. Data is retrived from data base and returned as a DTO with a view name
6. DispatcherServlet sends a view name to ViewResolver
7. DispatcherServlet receives a view template from ViewResolver
8. DispatcherServlet sends the view and data to view enginer
9. DispatcherServlet receives data-filled view
10. DispatcherServlet sends the view as an http response to font end.
### 5.  What is JSP and What is ModelAndView？(please google to have a basic knowlege)
JSP is a Java standard technology built on Java Servelet with access to Java standard APIs such as JDBC, where you can write embeded Java code within HTML files to connnect the backend-end Java code with front-end components.
ModelAndView is an object under Spring Web MVC framework that sends a simple string as model and delegates it with a specifed jsp view to front end.
### 6.  Could you please google any other servlets(理解多少是多少，不要花太多时间，知道servlet的名字就行。)
GenericServlet defines general-usage, protocol-independent servlet.
HttpServlet provides http specific servlet.
