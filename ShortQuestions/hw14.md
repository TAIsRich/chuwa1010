#### 5.  How do we use session and cookie to keep user information across the the application?
When a user send a request to the server, the server would generate a session to record this user,
then the server response this session id to the client,
the client store the session id in cookie,
when the next time the user have a new request, the client would send the information in cookie to the server,
the server will pick the session id in cookie to figure out which user is.
#### 6.  What is the spring security filter?
filter help us filter things. Since the spring security use the filter chains to work. Each filter have their specific standard to select the right information and allow the pass.
For example the UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter would only allows the request with correct username-password pair pass to the next filter.

AuthenticationProvider is similar with authenticationManager, but it allow developer to query the authentications that supports.
AuthenticationManager is the interface that support the authentication strategy,
AuthenticationFilter a filter that performs authentication of request.

#### 9.  What is the disadvantage of Session? how to overcome the disadvantage?

the client store the jwt in cookie, at the next time when the client request again, the server would get the jwt from headers and validate it.
And then return its response.

authentication means that figure out the user, usually check whether username-password correct.
