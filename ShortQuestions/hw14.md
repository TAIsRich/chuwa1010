MVC pattern: Model–view–controller (MVC). Spring MVC Framework follows the Model-View-Controller design pattern. It is used to develop web applications

Model: The Model encapsulates the application data.

View: View template receives the model containing data. It reads the model and displays the data. It generates HTML output that the client’s browser can interpret.

Controller: The Controller processes the user requests and passes them to the view for rendering

Front-Controller: Front Controller is DispatcherServlet. It's used to create web applications and REST services in Spring MVC.

**4**

DispatchServlet: The DispatcherServlet is the front controller in Spring web applications. It's used to create web applications and REST services in Spring MVC.

1) Tomcat receives HTTP request and sent the request to DispatchServlet to handle.

2) DispatchServlet receives the request and call HandlerMapper.

3) HandlerMapper will find corresponding Controller and method and return them to DispatchServlet.

4) DispatchServlet calls the method in corresponding controller and trigger call service, repository and database.

5) ModelAndView wll be returned from controller. Usually returns the view name(String) and data is set in the Model.

6) DispatchServlet will call the ViewResolver acccording to the view name.

7) ViewResolver will help to find view template(.jsp).

8) With template and data model, DispatchServlet calls View Engine to put data in the view template and transfer to HTML.

9) HTML is what front controller shows and will be returned to browser.

JSP: Jakarta Server Pages (formerly Java Server Pages) is a Java standard technology that developers use to write dynamic, data-driven web pages for Java web applications. 

ModelAndView(MAV): ModelAndView is a holder for both Model and View in the web MVC framework. These two classes are distinct; ModelAndView merely holds both to make it possible for a controller to return both model and view in a single return value.

An HTTP servlet is a special type of servlet that handles an HTTP request and provides an HTTP response, usually in the form of an HTML page.

Generic servlets: Extend javax.servlet.GenericServlet. Are protocol independent. They contain no inherent HTTP support or any other transport protocol.
