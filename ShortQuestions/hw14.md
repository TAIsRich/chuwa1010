###### 1. List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotaitons.md
###### 2. What is HTTP Session?
HTTP sessions is an industry standard feature that allows Web servers to maintain user identity and to store user-specific data during multiple request/response interactions between a client application and a Web application.
###### 3. What is Cookie?
Cookies are files with small pieces of data — like a username and password — that are used to identify the computer while using a computer network. Specific cookies known as HTTP cookies are used to identify specific users and improve web browsing experience.
###### 4. What is the difference between Session and Cookie?
Cookies are client-side files on a local computer that hold user information while Sessions are server-side files that contain user data. Cookies end on the lifetime set by the user while session is over when the user quits the browser or logs out of the programmed. 
Session is more secure than cookies and stores more data. 
###### 5. How do we use session and cookie to keep user information across the application?
With cookie-based session management, a message (cookie) containing user information is sent to the browser by the web server. 
This cookie is sent back to the server when the user tries to access certain pages. 
The cookie allows the server to identify the user and retrieve the user session from the session database, so that the user session is maintained. 
A cookie-based session ends when the user logs off or closes the browser. 
###### 6. What is the spring security filter?
A security filter describes a set of records in a table that a user has permission to access. The purpose of the security filter is to enforce authorization policies for the web application. In other words, the security filter makes sure that users only access the resources for which they are authorized.
###### 7. Do you use any Encoder to encode Password?
BCryptPasswordEncoder
###### 8. What is UserDetailService? AuthenticationProvider? AuthenticationManager? AuthenticationFilter?(把这⼏个名字看熟悉也⾏)
- UserDetailsService - default configuration provided by Spring security and further customizing it according to requirements.
It is used to retrieve user-related data. Its primary responsibility is to find a user by its username

- AuthenticationProvider - Authentication providers are responsible to perform a specific authentication

- AuthenticationManager - AuthenticationManager manages the authentication modules that an application uses. Authentication Manager delegates the request to the right Authentication Provider and returns the Authenticated Object to Authentication Filter

- AuthenticationFilter - Authentication filters let you set an authentication scheme for individual controllers or actions. Authentication Filter creates an Authentication Request and Passes to Authentication Manager.
###### 9. What is the disadvantage of Session? how to overcome the disadvantage?
sessions make it more difficult to keep servers in balance. 
A server can become overloaded if it accumulates too many sessions, or if specific sticky sessions require a high number of resources. 
This could result in your load balancer having to shift a client to a different server mid-session, resulting in data loss.

###### 10. What is JWT?
JWT stands for JSON Web Token
It is an open standard that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed.
###### 11. decribe how do JWT work(slides ⾥有图， 26页)
1. Client sends a POST request with username and password
2. Server validates the username and password then generates the JWT using secret key
3. Server returns the generated JWT to client
4. Client sends a GET request with the JWT Header information to act on permitted actions
5. Server validates the JWT with secret key and returns the response
###### 12. how to get value from application.properties?
use @Value annotation
@Value ("${value_from_application_properties}")
private string name
###### 13. What is the role of configure(HttpSecurity http) and configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)?
configure(HttpSecurity http) enables users to easily configure Spring Security/handle security exceptions by setting authorization 
configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)  enable the authentication based on userDetailsService records(password correct or not)
###### 14. What is Spring security authentication and authorization?
Authentication is knowing the identity of the user. 
For example, Alice logs in with her username and password, and the server uses the password to authenticate Alice.

Authorization is deciding whether a user is allowed to perform an action. 
For example, Alice has permission to get a resource but not create a resource.
