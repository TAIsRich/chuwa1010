###### 2. What is Spring and Springboot? What is the benfits of using Srpingboot?
- Spring is an application development framework in Java. Main features of Spring includes Spring MVC, JDBC, Security, ORM, AOP, Test, Web Flow, etc..
- Spring Boot is an extension of Spring, which eliminates the boilerplate configurations required for setting up a Spring application. Featuring default codes and annotation based configuration, Spring Boot enables a faster and more efficient development ecosystem.
###### 3. What is IOC and What is DI?
- IOC stands for Inversion of Control. It creates the objects, configures and assembles their dependencies, manages their entire life cycle. 
- DI stands for Dependency Injection. It's the main functionality provided by Spring IOC. 
###### 4. What is @CompnonentScan?
@ComponentScan enables @Component scan on the package where the application is located
###### 5. How to define which package spring need to scan in xml and annotaiton?
- xml - <context:component-scan base-package="..."/>
- annotation - put @ComponentScan(basePackages = {...}) annotation before the class
###### 6. What is @SpringbootApplication?
A single @SpringBootApplication annotation can be used to enable three features including:
- @Configuration, which declares a class as the source for bean definitions
- @EnableAutoConfiguration, which allows the application to add beans using classpath definitions
- @ComponentScan, which directs Spring to search for components in the path specified
###### 7. How many ways we can define a bean?
- Class level - @Component, @Service, @Repository, @Controller
- Method level - @Bean (used with @Configuration together)
- XML - <bean id="..." class="..."></bean>
###### 8. What is default bean name for @Component and @Bean?
- default bean name for @Component is class name converting the first character to lower case. 
- default bean name for @Bean is method name converting the first character to lower case. 
###### 9. What is the difference between @component and @service,@repository?
They are mostly the same, except that they are used for different layers(service, repository, controller). @Component is generic. 
###### 10. How many annotaitons we can use to inject the bean?
- @Autowired
- @Resource
- @Inject
###### 11. Tell me the three types to do dependency injection(How can we inject the beans in Spring)? Which way is better and why?
- Constructor Injection
```
@Autowired
public void setJpaICC(JpaICC jpaICC) {
    this.jpaICC = jpaICC;
}
```
- Settter Injection
```
@Autowired
public void setJpaICC(JpaICC jpaICC) {
    this.jpaICC = jpaICC;
}
```
- Field Injection
```
@Autowired
private JpaICC jpaICC;
```
Constructor injection is better. It allows us to create immutable objects, preventing NullPointerExceptions and other errors.
###### 12. If we have multiple beans for one type, how to set one is primary? and how to let the spring to pick one bean to inject if no primay.
- Use @Primary annotation
- Use @Qualifier annotation
###### 13. What is the difference between BeanFactory and ApplicationContext in Spring?
BeanFactory loads beans on-demand, while ApplicationContext loads all beans at startup. 
ApplicationContext comes with more features, including - 
1. Automatic BeanPostProcessor registration
2. Automatic BeanFactoryPostProcessor registration
3. Convenient MessageSource access (for i18n)
4. ApplicationEvent publication
###### 14. What is the Scope of a Bean? and list the examples for each scope.
- singleton - This scopes the bean definition to a single instance per Spring IoC container (default).
- prototype - This scopes a single bean definition to have any number of object instances.
- request - This scopes a bean definition to an HTTP request. Only valid in the context of a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext.
- session - This scopes a bean definition to an HTTP session. Only valid in the context of a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext.
- global-session - This scopes a bean definition to a global HTTP session. Only valid in the context of a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext.
###### 15. Configure a bean using xml. If bean has parameters/dependencies, how can we configure the bean? (you can google the tutorial how to configure beans in xml, and feel free to ask me any quesitons if you don't understand. it is a little bit old, I am not sure if I need to exaplain it in class)
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"

	<bean id="exampleBean" class="examples.ExampleBean">
		<property name="dependencyBean" >
            	<ref local="dependencyBeanBean"/>
        	</property>
    	</bean>
	  
	<bean id="dependencyBeanBean" class="examples.dependencyBeanBean"></bean>
  
</beans>
```
