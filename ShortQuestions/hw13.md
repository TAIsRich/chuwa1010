2. The Spring Framework provides a comprehensive programming and configuration model for modern Java-based enterprise applications. Spring Boot is a tool which can help you set up a Spring-based application with minimal configuration and setup.
3. IOC means inversion of control which is a software design principle that asserts a program can benefit in terms of pluggability, testability, usability and loose coupling if the management of an application's flow is transferred to a different part of the application. DI means dependency injection which enables you to turn regular Java classes into managed objects and to inject them into any other managed object.
4. @ComponentScan annotation is used to specify the packages that we want to be scanned for use with @Configuration classes.
5. Using context:component-scan in xml and @ComponentScan in annotation.
6. @SpringBootApplication annotation is used to mark a configuration class that declares one or more @Bean methods and also triggers auto-configuration and component scanning.
7. Annotating the class with @Component annotation, writing a bean factory method annotated with the @Bean annotation, or declaring a bean definition in an XML file.
8. The class name for @Component and the method name for @Bean.
9. @Component is a generic stereotype for any Spring-managed component, @Service annotates classes at the service layer, and @Repository annotates classes at the persistence layer.
10. @Autowired, @Resource and @Inject.
11. Constructor injection, field injection, and setter injection. Constructor injection is better because it creates immutable objects.
12. Using @Primary to set one bean as prime, and using @Qualifier to let the spring to pick one bean to inject if no primary.
13. The ApplicationContext comes with advanced features than the BeanFactory. But the BeanFactory is more lightweight since it loads beans on-demand, while ApplicationContext loads all beans at startup.
14. - Singleton: This scopes the bean definition to a single instance per Spring IoC container (default).
    - Prototype: This scopes a single bean definition to have any number of object instances.
    - Request: This scopes a bean definition to an HTTP request. Only valid in the context of a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext.
    - Session: This scopes a bean definition to an HTTP session. Only valid in the context of a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext.
    - Global-session: This scopes a bean definition to a global HTTP session. Only valid in the context of a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext.
