# Homework 13
### 1. List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotations.md
### 2.  What is Spring and Springboot? What is the benefits of using Springboot?
Spring is a Java application development framework that uses dependency injection to achieve loose coupling design. Spring boot is a extended spring framework mainly for building REST APIs with auto-configuration that makes rapid development easier.
### 3.  What is IOC and What is DI?
IOC is Inversion of Control that gives the control to the framework instead of initiating control from java class like in conventional OOP. Dependency Injection is used to inject relevant java instances stored in IOC containers to the class needed so that the different components of an application can be independently developed and run.
### 4.  What is  @ComponentScan?
`@ComponentScane` defines a specified path for Spring to search for components to put into IOC container.
### 5.  How to define which package spring need to scan in xml and annotation?
XML:
```xml
<bean id="componentName"  class="ComponentName"></bean>
```
Java Class:
```java
@Bean //method level
@Component
@Service
@Controller
@Repository
```
### 6.  What is  @SpringbootApplication?
`@SpringbootApplication` is the combination of `@Configuration`, `@EnableAutoConfiguration`, and `@ComponentScan`, which defines a class as the source for bean definitions, enable classpath definitions for bean scan, and directs the scane folder to the current class path.
### 7. How many ways wo can define a bean?
You can directly decorates the java class with annotations such as `@Component`, `@Service` to define a bean, define the bean in xml, or at method level with `@Bean` and `@Configuration`
### 8.  What is default bean name for  @Component and  @Bean?
The default bean name for `@Component` is the class name with first letter lower-cased.
The default bean name for `@Bean` is the method name.
### 9.  What is the difference between  @component and  @service, @repository?
`@Component` is a general-usaged decorator to let IOC container to manage the bean, while the other two are specific stretypes used only on their specfic level. 
### 10. How many annotations we can use to inject the bean?
1. `@Autowired` looks for bean by type then by name
2. `@Resource` looks for bean by name then by type
3. `@Inject` is the Java standard version of Spring `@Autowired`
### 11. Tell me the three types to do dependency injection(How can we inject the beans in Spring)? Which way is better and why?
`@Autowired` with a declared field, a setter method, or a constructor. By constructor is safest way to do dependency injection, but field injection is better as it requires less code writing.
### 12. If we have multiple beans for one type, how to set one is primary? and how to let the spring to pick one bean to inject if no primary.
We can use `@Primary` to prioritize the bean. If no primary is defined at bean level, Spring will go with `@Qualifier` and then by name to find the bean, with exception thrown unique bean is not found.
### 13. What is the difference between BeanFactory and ApplicationContext in Spring?
BeanFactory uses lazy-load for beans, while ApplicationContext uses eager-load and has extended features to atuomatically register beans.
### 14. What is the Scope of a Bean?  and list the examples for each scope.
1. Singleton (By default), such as service, controller, and repository.
2. Prototype, such as DTO.
### 15. Configure a bean using xml. If bean has parameters/dependencies, how can we configure the bean? (you can google the tutorial how to configure beans in xml, and feel free to ask me any questions if you don't understand. it is a little bit old, I am not sure if I need to explain it in class)
- Use `<import resource="dependencies.xml"/>` to import external beans defined in other file
- Use `<property name="dependency" ref="publicBean"/>` to import specfic dependency for a bean
- Use `<property name="parameter" value = "samplePara"/>` to define a defualt value for a parameter
