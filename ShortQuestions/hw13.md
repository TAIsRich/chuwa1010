#### 2.  What is Spring and Springboot? What is the benfits of using Srpingboot?

    Both of them are frameworks of java
    Spring has the ability to autowire the dependency at run time, which allows the developer to write loosely coupled code

#### 3.  What is IOC and What is DI?

    IOC(Inversion Of Control) is a design pattern and used to discoupling.
    DI(Dependency Injection) is the way to implement the IOC

#### 4.  What is  @CompnonentScan?
    @CommpnonentScan is used to define where the spring need to scan the bean definitions and generate the beans

#### 5.  How to define which package spring need to scan in xml and annotaiton?
    i. <context:component-scan base-package="package_name"/>
    ii.@ComponentScan(basePackages ={"package_nam"})

#### 6.  What is  @SpringbootApplication?
    Combines @Configuration, @EnableAutoConfiguration and @ComponentScan
    @SpringbootApplication can define and search beans, allow the application add bean ands

#### 7. How many ways wo can define a bean?
   use annotation @Component, @Service, @Repository, @Controller, @Beam(with @Configuration)
    Or in xml film declare <bean id="id" class="class"></bean>

#### 8.  What is default bean name for  @Component and  @Bean?
    default bean name is the method name annotated by @Bean

#### 9.  What is the difference between  @component and  @service,@repository?
    No different affect, but use different annotation words to figure out the layers 

#### 10. How many annotaitons we can use to inject the bean?
    @Autowired, priority: by type> by name
    @Resource, priority: by name> by type
    @Inject

#### 11. Tell me the three types to do dependency injection(How can we inject the beans in Spring)? Which way is better and why?
    Contstructor injection, this way is the better one, since it is the safest one
    Setter injection
    Field injection
#### 12. If we have multiple beans for one type, how to set one is primary? and how to let the spring to pick one bean to inject if no primay.
    use @Primary annotate the bean type method

    @Bean
    @Primary
    public BeanInterface bean1(){ return new bean1()}

    Or use @Qualifier annotate before the bean

    @Qualifier("bean1")
    private BeanInterface bean;
    
    Then would check the variable name, if application has bean had same name, pick this bean, otherwise throw NoUniqueBeanDefinitionException

    
#### 13. What is the difference between BeanFactory and ApplicationContext in Spring?
    Both of them are used to bean instantiation and writing,
    but the ApplicationContext support BeanFactoryPostProcessor, BeanPostProcessor automatically resgister, MessageSource access and ApplicationEvent publication
#### 14. What is the Scope of a Bean?  and list the examples for each scope.
    singleton: bean defination is a singele instance for each Spring Ioc container

    ApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(BeanConfig.class);
    The BeanConfig is a singleton in context.

    Prototype: every time we use a bean, create a bean objection.


#### 15. Configure a bean using xml. If bean has parameters/dependencies, how can we configure the bean? (you can google the tutorial how to configure beans in xml, and feel free to ask me any quesitons if you don't understand. it is a little bit old,I am not sure if I need to exaplain it in class)
    <bean class="com.baeldung.springbootxml.example">
        <property name="field" value="${sample}"></property>
    </bean>
