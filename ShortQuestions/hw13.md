##### 1.List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotaitons.md

##### 2.What is MVC pattern?

It stands for Model-View-Controller pattern.

Model represents the business layer, it is a container for data. 

View represents the presentation layer, it is used to visualize the model's data.

Controller works on both the model and view, it controls the data flow into model and updates the view.

##### 3.What is Front-Controller?

Front Controller receives all requests and dispatches them to different controllers, view resolver and view engine.

##### 4.What is DispatcherServlet? please describe how it works.

DispatcherServlet is a Front Controller.

- receives the HTTP request and call the **Handler Mapper** to find the corresponding controller and method
- call the corresponding **Controller** to preform the method, controller will add the data to the model, and return the model and view-name
- call the **View Resolver** to find the view template according to the view name
- call the **View Engine** to put the model into the view template and get the HTML response
- return the response to the client

##### 5.What is JSP and What is ModelAndViewï¼Ÿ

JSP stands for Java Server Pages. It is a templating technology for the HTML page. It can be used as view technology in Spring MVC. 

ModelAndView is a holder for both **Model** and **View** in the web MVC framework. It holds both to make it possible for a controller to return both model and view in a single return value. 

The model is a Map that stores data. The view can be a String view name or a view object that will need to be resolved by View Resolver
