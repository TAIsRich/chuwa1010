1. ######  List all of the new learned annotations to your annotations.md

2. ###### what is selenium(YouTube)?

   Selenium is an umbrella project for a range of tools and libraries that enable and support the automation of web browsers. It provides extensions to emulate user interaction with browers, a distribution server for scaling browser allocation, and the infrastructure for implementation of W3C WebDriver specification that lets you write interchangeable code for all major web browsers.

3. ###### what is cucumber(youtueb)?

   Cucumber is a testing tool that supports Behavior Driven Development. It offers a way to write tests that anybody can understand, regardless of their technical knowledge. In BDD, users. first write scenarios or acceptance test that describe the behavior of the system from the customer's perspective, for review and sign-off by the product owners before developers write their codes. 

4. ###### what is JMeter(youtube)?

   JMeter can test various applications. Following are some applications that can be tested:

   * Websites - HTTP and HTTPS
   * Web Services - REST and SOAP
   * Database Servers
   * FTP Servers
   * LDAP Servers
   * Mail Servers
   * Shell Scripts
   * TCP Servers
   * Message-oriented middleware through JMS
   * Java

5. ###### what is unit-test?

   Unit testing is used to test specific modules of source code, in turn, to validate the correctness of the code, coverage, implementation and maintenance of coding standards, verification of the functionality covered by the piece of code.

6. ###### What is the lifecircle of Junit?

   Normally, a test class contains multiple test methods. JUnit manages the exception of each test method in form of a lifecycle.

   The complete lifecycle of a test case can be seen in three phase with the help of annotations.

   1. **Setup**: This phase puts the test infrastructure in place. JUnit provides class level setup(`@BeforeAll`)and method level setup(`@BeforeEach). Generally, heavy objects like database connections are created in class level setup while lightweight objects like test objects are reset in the method level setup.

   2. **Test Execution**: In this phase. the test execution and assertion happen. The execution result will signify a success or failure.

   3. **CleanUP**: This phase is used to cleanup the test infrastructure setup in the first phase. Just like setup, teardown also happen at class level(`@AfterAll`) and method level(`@AfterEach`).

7. ###### Is @BeforeAll method should be Class level(static)?

   **`@BeforeAll`** and  **`@AfterAll`** annotations should be called only once in the entire tests execution cycle. So they must be declared **static**.

8. ###### What is Mockito? and what is its limitations?

   The main purpose of using the Mockito framework is to simplify the development of a test by mocking external dependencies and use them in the test code. As a result, it provides a simpler test code that is easier to read, understand, and modify. We can also use Mockito with other testing frameworks like **JUnit** and **TestNG**.

   Mockito doesn't support mocking of local variables, static emthods and private methods. So, we can use PowerMockito to overcome the limitation. Powermockito provides capabilities to work with the Java Reflection API in a simple way to solve the problems of Mockito, such as the lack of ability to mock final, static or private methods.

9. ###### What is @Mock and what is @InjectMocks?

   * **`@Mock`**: It is used to mock the objects that helps in minimizing the repetitve mock objects. It makes the test code and verification error easier to read as parameter names (field names) are used to identify the mocks. 
   * **`@InjectMocks`**: It marks a field or parameter on which the injection should be performed. It allows shorthand mock and spy injections and minimizes the repetitive mocks and spy injection. In Mockito, the mocks are injected either by setter injection, constructor injection, and property injection.

10. ###### What is the stubbing?

    Stubs store specified data and utilize it to generate replies for tests. In other terms, a stub is an object that looks like a genuine object but only has the methods required for testing. When we don't want to utilize objects that might respond with actual data, we use stubs instead. The lightest and most static kind of test double is known as a stub.

11. ###### what is Mockito ArgumentMatchers

    Argument matchers are mainly used for performing flexible verification and stubbing in Mockito. It extends ArgumentMatchers class to access all the matcher functions. Mockito uses equal() as a legacy method for verification and matching of argument values. In some cases, we need more flexibility during the verification of argument values, so we should use argument matchers instead of equal() method.

12. ###### what is Hamcrest Matchers

    The Hamcrest framework was designed to accommodate different types of unit testing frameworks. For example, Hamcrest can be used with TestNG and JUnit. The Hamcrest framework is also used with mocking frameworks such as JMock, EasyMock and Mockito.

13. ###### do you know @spy? what is difference between @spy and @Mock?

    `@Spy`: It allows the creation of partially mock objects. In other words, it allows shorthand wrapping of the field instances in a spy object. 

    `@Spy` and `@Mock` both can be used to mock methods or fields. The difference is that in mock, you are creating a complete mock or fake object while in spy, there is the real object and you just spying or stubbing specific methods of it.

    While in spy objects, since it is a real method, when you are not stubbing the method, then it will call the real method behavior. If you want to change and mock the method, then you to stub it.

    In short, a mcok is a normal mock and a spy is a partial mock.
