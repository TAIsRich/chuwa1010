# hw50 microservice

*1. list all of the new annotations you learned to your annotations.md*
*2. Document the microservice architeture and components/tools/dependencies*

 *Microservice is an architecture design pattern. It splits one large application into multiple*
*small and independent service based applications. Each service only does one thing.*

Components:  1. Spring Cloud  2. Zuul API Gateway. 3. Eureka. 4. Ribbon Load Balancer 5. Hystrix Circuit Breaker. 6. Config Server  7. Kafka.  8. Docker

*3. What are Resilience patterns? What is circuit breaker?*

Common resiliency patterns used in application development include the bulkhead pattern and circuit breaker pattern. These patterns often incorporate other resiliency techniques like fallback, retry, and timeout.

The circuit breaker pattern is an application resiliency pattern used to limit the amount of requests to a service based on configured thresholds — helping to prevent the service from being overloaded.

 Microservices are independently deployable modules.

For example, an e-commerce system can be divided into modules for:

- ordering
- registration
- product search

    Normally, all of these modules would be implemented together in one application. In this case, a change in one of the modules can only be brought into production by bringing a new version of the entire application with all its modules into production. However, when the modules are implemented as microservices, the ordering process cannot only be changed independently of the other modules, but it can even be brought into production independently.

    This speeds up deployment and reduces the number of necessary tests since only a single module needs to be deployed. Due to this greater level of decoupling, a large project can turn into a number of smaller projects. Each project is in charge of an individual microservice.

    To achieve this at the technical level, every microservice has to be an independent process. A better solution for decoupling microservices is to provide an independent virtual machine or Docker container for each microservice.

   In that case, a deployment will replace the Docker container of an individual microservice with a new Docker container, which starts the new version and its direct requests. The other microservices will not be affected if such an approach is used.
