1. What is generic in Java? and type the generic code by yourself.
   a. https://github.com/TAIsRich/chuwa-eij-tutorial/tree/main/02-java-core
   /src/main/java/com/chuwa/tutorial/t01_basic/generic  
The idea is to allow type to be a parameter to methods, classes, and interfaces.  
Using generics, it is possible to create classes that work with different data types.
2. Read those codes and type it one by one by yourself. the push the code to your
   branch.

3. practice stream API at least 3 times

4. Write the Singleton design pattern include eager load and lazy load.
5. What is Runtime Exception? could you give me some examples?  
A runtime exception is caught at runtime.  
Eg: Arithmetic Exception; ArrayIndexOutOfBounds Exception
6. Could you give me one example of NullPointerException?  
The NullPointerException typically occurs when you declare a variable but did not create an object and assign it to the variable before trying t ouse the contents of the variable.
So you have a reference to something that does not actually exist.
Eg:
```aidl
Integer num;
num=new Integer(10);
```
7. What is the Optional class?  
The Optional class in Java is a container that can hold, at max, one value and gracefully deals with null values.
8. What is the @FunctionalInterface?  
@FunctionalInterface annotation is used to ensure that the functional interface can't have more than one abstract method.
9. what is lamda?  
   Lambda Expression was added in Java 8.
   A lambda expression is a short block of code which takes in parameters and returns a value. Lambda expressions are similar to methods, but they do not need a name and they can be implemented right in the body of a method.
   The lambda expression is used to provide the implementation of an interface which has functional interface. It saves a lot of code.
   Syntax:
   The simplest lambda expression contains a single parameter and an expression:
   parameter -> expression
   To use more than one parameter, wrap them in parentheses:
   (parameter 1, parameter 2) -> expression
   numbers.forEach( (n) -> {System.out.println(n); } );
10. What is Method Reference?  
Java provides a new feature called method reference in Java 8.   
Method reference is used to refer method of functional interface.
11. What is Java 8 new features?   
Java 8 new features: Reference; Default method and static method in interface; Lambda&Functional Interface;
Optional; Method Reference; Stream API
12. Lambda can use unchanged variable outside of lambda? what is the details?  
Final variable; Non-final variable however never changed; Object variable
