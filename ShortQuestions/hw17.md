###### 1. list all of the new annotations you learned to your annotations.md
###### 2. Document the microservice architeture and components/tools/dependencies
Microservice is an architecture design pattern. It splits one large application into multiple small and independent service based applications. Each service only does one thing.
Good/Advantage of Microservice
- You can update/modify one service without downtime of the entire application. i.e. amazon prime: prime day service
- You can easily scale up to add more services
- For each service, you can use different tech stacks
Bad/Drawbacks of Microservice
- Communication between services requires more time and resources
- DevOps â€“ need more server and people to maintain each servers
Components
Gateway - route the incoming request to different services
Eureka - register every service provided
Ribbon - load balancer, distribute traffic evenly
Hystrix - circuit breaker, when a system call result in an error that exceeds the default value, the circuit breaker is opened and does not allow any calls tp pass through
Config server - utilized to configure different services
Kafka - a distributed event store and stream-processing platform for services to communicate asynchronously
Docker - every service is stored in its own docker and has its own database
###### 3. What are Resilience patterns? What is circuit breaker?
Resiliency patterns are a type of service architecture that help to prevent cascading failures and to preserve functionality in the event of service failure. There are below resilience patterns - 
- Time out - prevents a microservice from waiting too long for another microservice
- Fail fast - generates an error as quickly as possible
- Bulkhead - Hystrix can use its own thread pool for each type of request
- Circuit breaker - If a system call results in an error, the circuit breaker is opened and does not allow any calls to pass through
Circuit breakers are a design pattern to create resilient microservices by limiting the impact of service failures and latencies. The major aim of the Circuit Breaker pattern is to prevent any cascading failure in the system. In a microservice system, failing fast is critical.
