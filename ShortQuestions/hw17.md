## AOP&Batch&Swagger

### 1. List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotations.md
### 2. Briefly reading: https://www.techgeeknext.com/spring-boot/spring-aop-interview-questions
### 3. What is the Aspect Oriented Programming?
Aspect Oriented Programming is to slice a linear process into stages and insert "aspect" before or after the execution of each stage, which increases code reusability and promotes loose coupling.
### 4. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Spring AOP?
#### Advantages:
1. Easy to configure
2. No other external compilation unit is required.
3. Uses Spring IOC container for dependency injection.
4. Can create aspects using annotations or XML.
5. It integrates cross-cutting concerns into the classes.
#### Disadvantages:
1. Debugging AOP framework-based application can be challenging.
2. AOP are only recommended only with public methods.
3. Aspects cannot be advised by other aspects.
### 5. What is Aspect in Spring AOP?
It is a wrapper for a group of actions that can be inserted before or after a method.
### 6. What is Pointcut in Spring AOP?
Pointcut is an expression that chooses one or more join points where AOP aspects can be applied.
### 7. What is the Join point in Spring AOP?
It is where AOP aspects can be applied.
### 8. What does it mean by Advice and its types in Spring AOP?
Advice is WHEN the inserted aspect would be executed. There are five kind: `@Before`, `@After`, `@After-returning`, `@After-throwing`, and `@Around`.
### 9. What is Spring AOP Proxy?
AOP proxy is an object that is formed when advice is applied to a target object, in which a JDK dynamic proxy is used by Spring AOP to build proxy classes with target classes and advice invocations.

### 11. When to use Spring Batch?
Spring Batch is usually needed when actions, such as read, write, transforming data, database transactions, or other IO actions, need to be executed repeatedly with large number of times under a enterprise environment and in which might also require parallel or sequential steps.
### 12. How Spring Batch works?
A step, which can do either a read, transformation, write, is delegated by a job through JobRepository and is launched by JobLauncher many times to batch process data.
### 13. How can we schedule a Spring Batch Job?
A Spring Batch Job can be scheduled using a cron.

### 14. What is Swagger?
Swagger is a documentation tool used to visualize the structure of APIs directed by different url path variables.
