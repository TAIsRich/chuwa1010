2. First create the proper test cases and then read the error messages if there is any and also check if the result is desired. Then we can add breakpoints and see if the values of field is correct at a certain point and locate where the problem is. Then we can fix the code by it.
3. 
   - DTO: Data Transfer Objects which encapsulates values to carry data between processes or networks
   - VO: Value Object, is a special type of object that can hold values such as java.lang.Integer and java.lang.Long
   - Payload: Contains the data that could be stored or updated such as the body in the HTTP request and response message
   - DO: Data object
4. @JsonProperty is used to mark non-standard getter/setter method to be used, in this case is for the property "description_yyds"
5. Jackson is a JSON processing library which is used for serializing Java objects or Map to JSON and vice-versa
6. Spring Boot Starters are dependency descriptors that can be added under the <dependencies> section in pom.xml. spring-boot-starter-web is the starter for building web, including RESTful, applications using Spring MVC and it uses Tomcat as the default embedded container.
7. @RequestMapping is used to map web requests to Spring Controller methods
   - Create: @RequestMapping(value = "/users", method = RequestMethod.POST)
   - Read: @RequestMapping(value = "/users/{id}", method = RequestMethod.GET)
   - Update: @RequestMapping(value = "/users/{id}", method = RequestMethod.PUT)
   - Delete: @RequestMapping(value = "/users/{id}", method = RequestMethod.DELETE)
8. ResponseEntity represents an HTTP response, including headers, body, and status. We need it to represent the HTTP response and have the full control of any part of it.
9. A ResultSet object is a table of data representing a database result set, which is usually generated by executing a statement that queries the database
10. ORM means Object Relational Mapping, and an ORM framework generates OOP objects that virtually map the tables in a database

12. Serialization is a mechanism of converting the state of an object into a byte stream. Deserialization is the reverse process where the byte stream is used to recreate the actual Java object in memory.

13. ```java
    int[] arr = new int[]{20, 3, 78, 9, 6, 53, 73, 99, 24, 32};
    return Arrays.stream(arr).average().getAsDouble();
    ```
