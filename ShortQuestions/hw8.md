Debug could be finished by checking the error message, locating the error code, adding breakpoints to the code, executing the debug program to checkout the info in this part. If the info in the breakpoint is right, then go to next breakpoint. Otherwise, modify the code so that the bug could be fixed.

DTO:  Data Transfer Object, encapsulates values to carry data between processes or networks. The only java class (created within the payload package).  make the code loosely coupled by decoupling the domain models from the presentation layer.

VO: Value Object, is a special type of object that can hold values such as java.lang.Integer and java.lang.Long.  always override the equals() and hashCode() methods.

Payload: the body of your request and response message. It contains the data that you send to the server when you make an API request. You can send and receive Payload in different formats, for instance JSON.

DO: data object, correspond with the database table structure, and the data source object is transmitted upward through the DAO layer.

 @JsonProperty marks non-stand
 ard getter/setter method to be used with respect to json property. used at the class level to ignore fields during serialization and deserialization.

**5**

 Jackson is one such Java Json library used for parsing and generating Json files. It has built in Object Mapper class which parses json files and deserializes it to custom java objects. It helps in generating json from java objects

Spring-boot-starter is the dependency descriptor that is added in pom.xml. In the Spring Boot Framework, all the starters follow a similar naming pattern: spring-boot-starter-* where * denotes its application.

E: spring-boot-starter-web -> It is used for building the web application, including RESTful applications using Spring MVC. It uses Tomcat as the default embedded container.

**7**

Before Spring 4.3, Spring had only @RequestMapping annotation for mapping all the incoming HTTP request URLs to the corresponding controller methods.

E: @RequestMapping(value = "/users", method = RequestMethod.POST) // /users -> the website URL to create the request POST

create: @RequestMapping(value = "/users", method = RequestMethod.POST)

read: @RequestMapping(value = "/users", method = RequestMethod.GET)

update: @RequestMapping(value = "/users/{id}", method = RequestMethod.UPDATE)

delete: @RequestMapping(value = "/users/{id}", method = RequestMethod.DELETE)


**8**

ResponseEntity is a generic type which represents the whole HTTP response: status code, headers, and body. As a result, we can use it to fully configure the HTTP response.


**9**

A ResultSet object is a table of data representing a database result set, which is usually generated by executing a statement that queries the database.

flow: load driver -> connnect to database -> define sql statement -> create a statement object -> use stmt object to execute sql statement -> get ResultSet's data to java object -> close connections and other souce(make sure close alls)

**10**

ORM framework stands for Objectâ€“relational mapping, a programming technique in which a metadata descriptor is used to connect object code to a relational database. Object code is written in object-oriented programming (OOP) languages such as Java or C#.

**12**

serialization: the process of converting an object into a stream of bytes to more easily save or transmit it.

desrialization: constructing a data structure or object from a series of bytes

```Java
@Test
    @DisplayName("get average")
    public void exercise16() {
        List<Integer> a = Arrays.asList(20, 3, 78, 9, 6, 53, 73, 99, 24, 32);
        double average = a.stream().mapToDouble(Integer::intValue).average().getAsDouble();
        System.out.println(average); // 39.7
    }
```
