### 3. _What are Resilience patterns? What is circuit breaker?_

- _Time out_

	- A timeout prevents a microservice from waiting too long for another _microservice._

- _Fail fast_

	-  Fail Fast describes a similar pattern. It is better to generate an error as_quickly as possible.

- _Bulkhead_

	- Hystrix can use its own thread pool for each type of request. For example, a separate thread pool can be set up for each called microservice.

- _Circuit breaker_
	-  If a system call results in an error, the circuit breaker is opened_and does not allow any calls to pass through.

### _4. Watching the below videos. and write your understanding about microservice._

- Before Microservices - Monolithic Architecture : it is like a big container wherein all the software components of an application are assembled together and tightly packaged.

- Microservice, is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small autonomous services, modelled around a Business Domain. 
- In MicroService Architecture, each service is self-contained and implements a single Business capability.
