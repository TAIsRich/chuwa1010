###### 1. List all of the new learned annotations to your annotations.md

###### 2. what is selenium(YouTube)?
Selenium is an automation testing suite for web applications across different browsers and platforms. It automates user interaction on pure HTML and JavaScript applications in browsers to test web applications. 
###### 3. what is cucumber(youtueb)?
Cucumber is a testing tool that supports Behavior Driven Development (BDD). It offers a way to write tests that anybody can understand, regardless of their technical knowledge. In BDD, users (business analysts, product owners) first write scenarios or acceptance tests that describe the behavior of the system from the customerâ€™s perspective, for review and sign-off by the product owners before developers write their codes. Given, when and then instructions are given to use the test tool. 
###### 4. what is JMeter(youtube)?
JMeter is a load testing tool for analyzing and measuring the performance of a variety of services, with a focus on web applications. 
###### 5. what is unit-test?
Unit testing involves the testing of each unit or an individual component of the software application. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software code performs as expected. Unit testing is done during development of an application by the developers. Unit may be an individual function, method, procedure, module, or object. Developers write unit test code. 
###### 6. What is the lifecircle of Junit?
The complete lifecycle of a test case can be seen in three phases with the help of annotations. 
Setup: 
- This phase puts the test infrastructure in place
- JUnit provides class level setup(@BeforeAll) and method level setup(@BeforeEach)
- Generally, heavy objects like database connections are created in class level setup while lightweight objects like test objects are reset in the method level setup
Test Execution: 
- In this phase, the test execution and assertion happen
- The execution result will signify a success or failure
Cleanup: 
- This phase is used to cleanup the test infrastructure setup in the first phase
- Just like setup, teardown also happen at class level (@AfterAll) and method level (@AfterEach)

###### 7. Is @BeforeAll method should be Class level(static)?
Yes. @BeforeAll and @AfterAll annotations should be called only once in the entire tests execution cycle. So they must be declared static at class level. 
###### 8. What is Mockito? and what is its limitations?
Mockito is a Java-based mocking framework used fore unit testing. It creates a mock object that returns dummy data and avoids external dependencies. 
Some limitation - 
1. It cannot mock local variables, static methods and private methods
2. It cannot mock equals(), hashCode() methods
3. VM mocking is only possible on VMs that are supported by Objenesis
4. It requires Java version 6 plus to run

###### 9. What is @Mock and what is @InjectMocks?
@Mock is used to create mocks that are needed to support the testing of the class to be tested
@InjectMocks creates an instance of the class and injects that mocks that are created with the @Mock annotations into this instance. 
###### 10. What is the stubbing?
A stub is a small piece of code that takes the place of another component during testing
The stubbing approach is easy to use and involves no extra dependencies for the unit test
It always returns the predefined output regardless of the input and you can run tests even if the other component are not working yet. 

###### 11. what is Mockito ArgumentMatchers
ArgumentMatchers are mainly used for performing flexible verifications and stubbing in Mockito. Mockito uses equal() as a legacy method for verification and matching of argument values. In some cases, we need more flexibility during the verification of argument values, so we should use ArgumentMatchers instead of equal() method. 
###### 12. what is Hamcrest Matchers
Hamcrest is a framework that assists writing software tests in Java
It supports creating customized assertion matchers ('Hamcrest' is an anagram of 'matchers'), allowing match rules to be defined declaratively. 
For example
List<Integer> num = Arrays.asList(99, 123, 45, 148, 33);

assertThat(num, hasSize(5));
assertThat(num, hasItems(99, 45));

assertThat(num, everyItem(greaterThan(20)));
assertThat(num, everyItem(greaterThanOrEqualTo(33)));
assertThat(num, everyItem(lessThan(150)));
###### 13. do you know @spy? what is difference between @spy and @Mock?
@Mock is used to create fully mock or dummy objects. When using mock objects, the default behavior of methods (when not stubbed) is do nothing (performs nothing).

@Spy is used for creating partial or half mock objects. When using spy objects, the default behavior of the methods (when not stubbed) is the real method behavior.
