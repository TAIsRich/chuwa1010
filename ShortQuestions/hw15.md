## HW15 - Testing

##### 1.List all of the new learned annotations to your annotations.md 

##### 2.what is selenium(YouTube)? 

Selenium is an open source web UI automation testing suite. It performs the tests by simulating user behaviors. It supports various operating systems, browsers and programming languages.

##### 3.what is cucumber(YouTube)? 

Cucumber is a testing tool that supports Behavior Driven Development. The BDD requires write the scenarios which describe the behavior of the system before write codes.

##### 4.what is JMeter(YouTube)? 

JMeter is a testing tool for load and performance testing. The performance testing includes load test and stress test of web application. JMeter can be used to test the performance of both static resources (JavaScript, HTML), and dynamic resources (JSP, Servlets, AJAX).

##### 5.what is unit-test? 

Unit Testing is a testing method that each unit or component of the application is being tested individually to validate that each part performs as expected.

##### 6.What is the lifecycle of Junit? 

- Setup: `@BeforeAll` (class level) `@BeforeEach` (method level)
- Test Execution: `@Test`
- Cleanup: `@AfterAll` (class level) `@AfterEach` (method level)

##### 7.Is @BeforeAll method should be Class level(static)? 

Yes. It will be executed only once before running all tests, and it have to be **static**.

##### 8.What is Mockito? and what is its limitations? 

Mockito is a mocking framework that creates mock objects for unit testing. A mock object is a dummy implementation for an interface or a class. It allows to define the output of certain method calls. Using Mockito allows to check certain method is running correctly and skip the details of its calling methods.

Limitation: lack of ability to mock final, static or private methods. -> use the **PowerMockito** instead

##### 9.What is @Mock and what is @InjectMocks? 

- `@Mock` creates a mock
- `@InjectMocks` creates a class instance and injects the mocks into it

##### 10.What is the stubbing? 

Stubbing is the process of creating stub objects during the testing. It returns the predefined output regardless of the input. It is generally used to reduce the complexities of creating the real objects by creating and holding the predefined data.

##### 11.what is Mockito ArgumentMatchers 

They are mainly used for the stub setup.

##### 12.what is Hamcrest Matchers 

They are mainly used for verification during the unit testing. They are used to check if the examined objects match to the expected value.

##### 13.do you know @spy? what is difference between @spy and @Mock?

@Spy is partially mock objects. Unlike @Mock, the spy object perform as normal (as the real object) by default, while we still can transform it and see it as the mock object when we need it.
