# Homework 15
## Spring Security
### 1. List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotations.md
### 2. What is HTTP Session?
After a user is authenticated, the server uses a session ID to identify actions initiated by this specific user, making it possible for user to making stateless http requests without the need to log in again, because the information is stored on the server's side with the lifetime until being logged out.
### 3. What is Cookie?
A cookie is locally stored data on the user's computer that can be accessed by web applications to give certain responses to the user, which has a lifetime specified by the user.
### 4. What is the difference between Session and Cookie?
A session is encrypted information stored on the server, while cookie is stored on the user's local machine.
### 5. How do we use session and cookie to keep user information across the the application?
After login, the web application should generate a unique session ID for current user's session and uses that session information to authenticate different requests made by the user until the user logs out. Cookies can be used to provide non-secure customized content across web applications when authentication is not necessary.
### 6. What is the spring security filter?
Spring security filters are layers in Spring security flow that decouples the handling of different steps in authentication through delegation and provides a framework in which different implementations of the same filter can be used to authorize different URL requests.
### 7. Do you use any Encoder to encode Password?
Yes. Password can be encoded by using encoder.encode() method provided by spring framework to store the encoded password in database.
### 8. What is UserDetailService? AuthenticationProvider?AuthenticationManager? AuthenticationFilter?(把这⼏个名字看熟悉也⾏)
- UserDetails Services queries the user information from database.
- AuthenticationProvider calls UserDetails and includes the business logic to check if the input matches the data stored in database.
- Authentication Manager delegates the request to Authentication Provider.
- Authentication Filter creates an Authentication Request and passes it to Authentication Provider.
### 9. What is the disadvantage of Session? how to overcome the disadvantage?
Session might cause performance issue on the server side when too many user are logged in because session data is serialized and stored on the server. Session can also only be used in one web application. However, by using JWT, one session can authenticate different web applications.
### 10. What is JWT?
JWT is Json Web Token that is used between a user and sever to identify an encrypted session.
### 11. describe how do JWT work(slides ⾥有图， 26页)
The server generates a unique JWT when a user logs in properly. The user receives JWT and stores it in cookies, which can be repeatedly used when making http requests. The server verifies the JWT with a secret key and returns a response if the JWT is valid.
### 12. how to get value from application.properties?
Use `@Value("${field-name}")` to inject the value defined in application.properties to Java field.
### 13. What is the role of configure(HttpSecurity http) and configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)?
- configure(HttpSecurity http) configures authorization based on url.
- configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auto) adds properties to a new/existing authenticationManager, which can refer to different implementations.
### 14. What is Spring security authentication and authorization?
Authentication verifies if a user is really the user by the correct credentials. Authorization gives the user different privilege to do certain things based on their role.
