## 1. List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotaitons.md

## 2. what is the @configuration and @bean?
@Bean: It is a method-level annotation. It is an alternative of XML <bean> tag. It tells the method to produce a bean to be managed by Spring Container.
@configuration: It is a class-level annotation. The class annotated with @Configuration used by Spring Containers as a source of bean definitions.
@Bean ans @configuration are used together to define a bean in Spring Containers.

## 3. How do you handle the exception in Spring?
@ExceptionHandler: method level, is used to detect certain runtime exceptions (such as ResourceNotFoundException) and send responses according to the exception; used to handle the specific exceptions and sending the custom responses to the client.
@ControllerAdvice: Class Level, is used to handle the exceptions globally. All the exceptions that are not handled yet will be handled by GlobalExceptionHandler.
Exception class is the root of all exceptions, so we use it to handle the global exceptions.
**Steps**
1. create ErrorDetails Class
2. Create GlobalExceptionHandler Class 
3. Test using Postman Client

## 4. How do you do the validations in Spring?
Validations in Spring is used to validate request Body, and return customized information.
1. import dependecy
```java
<dependency>
<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId> <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-validation</artifactId> <version>2.7.0</version>
</dependency>
```
2. Add validation Rule to payload:
```java
@NotEmpty
@Size(min=10, max=100, message="Title should have at least 10 characters and 100 characters at most.")
private string title
```
3. Add @valid to controller to apply the Rule here
```java
 public ResponseEntity<CommentDto> createComment(@PathVariable(value="postId") long id,
                                                    @Valid @RequestBody CommentDto commentDto) {
        return new ResponseEntity<>(commentService.createComment(id, commentDto), HttpStatus.CREATED);
    }
```
4. Check it in Postman

## 5. What is the actuator?
Spring Boot's 'Actuator' dependency is used to monitor and manage the Spring web application. We can use it to monitor and manage the application with the help of HTTP endpoints or with the JMX.
The following dependency is needed to enable actuator in Spring boot.
```java
<dependency>  
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>  
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>  
    <version>2.2.2.RELEASE</version>
